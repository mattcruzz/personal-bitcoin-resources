# Personal Bitcoin Resources
This is a collection of bitcoin core resources that I'm beginning to build up. The goal is to support Bitcoin by offering my time to learn and contribute through reviewing, testing, and writing code. \
If you have any suggestions on how I can improve please feel free to do so through a pull request, a dm on Twitter: @mc_madvillian, or an email: mattcruzz@protonmail.com.
