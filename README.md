# Personal Bitcoin Resources
This is a collection of bitcoin core resources that I'm beginning to build up. The goal is to support Bitcoin by offering my time by learning and contributing through testing, reviewing, and writing code (in that order). \
If you have any suggestions on how I can improve please feel free to do so through a pull request, a dm on Twitter: @mc_madvillian, or an email: mattcruzz@protonmail.com.
